This is meant to be a future WebApp for Firefox OS, a sound player for http://radiohyrule.com/

All tags are parsed from the site using YQL and audio played using an HTML5 audio tag. You can test this in Chrome, since the desktop version of Firefox does not support mp3 (Firefox OS does)

Recent changes:
-added toast notifications for tag loading and audio buffering
