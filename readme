This is meant to be a future WebApp for Firefox OS, a sound player for http://radiohyrule.com/

All tags are parsed from the site using YQL and audio played using an HTML5 audio tag. You can test this in Chrome, since the desktop version of Firefox does not support mp3 (Firefox OS does)

Current bugs:
-Occasionally the art and tags stop updating (investigating)
-Pausing kills the stream (I know what causes it. Working on this)
